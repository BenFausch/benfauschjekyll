oneHeader: About Me
oneCopy: I am a web developer specializing in working with small businesses who need
  a "rockstar" who "wears many hats" and can "switch between projects" at "any" point
  in time. <br><br>I speak VanillaJS, PHP, React, React Native, SQL (non, light and
  regular), Node, bash, and know enough Python and Basic to crash a drone into any
  office furniture in the room.
oneButtonOne: Buildin
oneButtonTwo: Scriptin
oneButtonThree: Stylin
twoHeaderOne: What makes me different from other developers?
twoCopyOne: I am a lean, mean coder. <br>I work fast to get a project up, and am not
  afraid of scrapping an entire codebase if the project takes a new direction. <br>I
  learn fast to get building. <br I won't take a 12 week bootcamp or even a 12 step
  class to learn something. <br>I will read the boring spec sheet and developer docs,
  and will break it until it works. <br> I am not afraid to get out of a library and
  write something in pure JS. <br>I am not afraid of PHP and know its merit in building
  the web despite flash-in-the-pan libraries that have taken over.  <br>I will script
  out my entire job if it means that I can work on the parts of the project that matter.
